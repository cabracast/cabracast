> Today is the day after yesterday  
> And yesterday didn't go so well  
> My love came down and assured me:  
> Sit down I have something to tell  
>   
> When I met you my eyes hurt  
> That is how beautiful you are  
> I don't suposse I could feel this way  
> If I still have you by my side  
> By my side  
>   
> I did not anticipate your candor  
> Even though I didn't know you too well  
>   
> You see one door close another door open  
> But these doors lead me straight to hell  
>   
> When I met you my eyes hurt  
> That is how beautiful you are  
>   
> I don't suposse I could feel this way  
> If I still have you by my side  
> By my side  
>   
> If I just broken all  
> I gave it all  
> That is how tired  
> I don't suppose I could feel all this way
